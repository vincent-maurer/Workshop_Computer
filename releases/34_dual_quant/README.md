# DualQuantPitch

This Readme is LLM output

A dual granular pitch shifter for the Workshop Computer platform.

This project implements two independent fixed-point granular pitch shifters running entirely inside the audio ISR at 48kHz on RP2040 hardware.

The design intentionally embraces a rough, lo-fi granular texture rather than attempting transparent studio-quality pitch shifting.

# Design Goals

This module was designed around several constraints:

* Stable real-time ISR execution
* Minimal CPU overhead
* Predictable timing behaviour
* Low memory usage
* No blocking operations
* No expensive transcendental math
* Musically useful degradation

The goal is not perfect transparency.

Instead, the module intentionally produces:

* gritty textures
* grain smearing
* metallic transients
* chorus-like motion
* unstable granular character

This makes the module particularly suitable for:

* drones
* ambient processing
* experimental synthesis
* tape-like pitch artefacts
* glitch textures
* modular feedback systems

# Architecture

## Circular Buffer

Incoming audio is written into a shared 2048-sample circular buffer.

Both pitch shifters read from this buffer independently using fixed-point read heads.

Power-of-two buffer sizing allows efficient wrapping using bitmask operations instead of modulo arithmetic.

```cpp
static const int32_t BUFFER_SIZE = 2048;
static const int32_t BUFFER_MASK = BUFFER_SIZE - 1;
```

---

## Fixed-Point Format

The DSP engine uses Q16.16 fixed-point arithmetic.

* Upper 16 bits: integer component
* Lower 16 bits: fractional component

Examples:

| Value  | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| 65536  | 1.0     |
| 32768  | 0.5     |
| 131072 | 2.0     |

Pitch values use Q8.8 fixed-point semitone representation.

---

## Granular Playback

Each output continuously reads through the delay buffer at a variable playback rate.

Read heads are periodically reset behind the write head to create overlapping grains.

This prevents uncontrolled drift while intentionally producing granular artefacts.

---

## Interpolation

Linear interpolation smooths playback between adjacent samples.

```cpp
sample = s1 + (((s2 - s1) * frac) >> FP_SHIFT);
```

64-bit intermediate multiplication is used to avoid overflow.

---

## Grain Window

Each grain uses a triangle amplitude envelope.

This reduces hard discontinuities at grain boundaries and helps minimise clicks.

The implementation uses shift operations instead of integer division for ISR efficiency.

# Outputs

| Output      | Function                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| Audio Out 1 | Pitch-shifted signal A    |
| Audio Out 2 | Pitch-shifted signal B    |
| CV Out 1    | Quantised pitch voltage A |
| CV Out 2    | Quantised pitch voltage B |

# Quantiser

The quantiser uses fixed-point chromatic rounding.

Pitch values are represented in Q8.8 semitone format.

The implementation correctly handles negative semitone values.

---

# Playback Ratios

Pitch shifting uses a precomputed ratio lookup table.

This avoids expensive floating-point operations such as `powf()` inside the ISR.

Ratios are intentionally approximate and musically tuned.

---

# Performance

The audio ISR runs at 48kHz.

Design optimisations include:

* fixed-point arithmetic
* lookup tables
* power-of-two buffer wrapping
* shift-based envelope calculations
* no heap allocation
* no floating point
* no modulo operations in hot paths

The system clock is configured to 144MHz to provide stable DSP headroom.

---

# Audio Character

Expected sonic characteristics:

* rough granular texture
* transient smearing
* grain overlap modulation
* metallic artefacts
* pitch instability at extreme shifts
* chorus-like motion at smaller intervals

The implementation intentionally prioritises character over transparency.

---

# Safety Notes

The DSP engine includes:

* startup buffer initialisation
* bounded circular addressing
* overflow-safe interpolation
* saturated output clamping
* deterministic ISR execution

All processing is designed to remain ISR-safe.

---

# Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

* alternative grain windows
* equal-power overlap curves
* stereo grain decorrelation
* feedback paths
* freeze mode
* reverse grains
* pitch scale selection
* microtonal quantisation
* grain jitter modulation
* clock-synchronised grain resets
