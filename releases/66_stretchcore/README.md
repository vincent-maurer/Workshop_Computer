## Demo

22 minutes of pure stretchcore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-iyoTLxIP8


## Audio Loading

Audio is loaded from the web app in `web/` over Web Serial (public instance at [infinitedigits.co/stretchcore/](https://infinitedigits.co/stretchcore/)). The firmware only needs to be flashed once with loader support; after that, sample banks can be replaced from the browser without reflashing firmware.

Samples are stored in flash as 48 kHz mono signed 8-bit PCM. The loader can read the device bank back, show capacity, preview samples, crop waveforms, and upload the full bank.
